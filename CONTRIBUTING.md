# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

## Get in Touch

If you want to contribute to the project without taking a hard fork please get in touch with the owner of the code by
email at
[julian@the-lair.info](mailto:julian@the-lair.info)

## Follow Conventions

The code is formatted according to PEP8 - please make sure you keep it that way to help save everyone's sanity

Repository branching is loosely following gitflow - do not attempt to commit to the master or development branches. Use
gitflow style naming, feat/<name> for features, fix/<name> for fixes, etc

Commit messages follow conventional commit format
([conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)). This is important as we all hate having to
rewrite historical commit messages

## Testing is Mandatory

The code has been written following TDD to make sure that it is both testable and correct

If you make changes then the tests must be maintained. If you cut new code follow TDD - writing the tests *after* you've
writen the code is not the right way of doing it

## Have Fun

This is meant to be for enjoyment, not a painful slog
